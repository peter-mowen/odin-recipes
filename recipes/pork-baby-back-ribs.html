        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Generic recipe for fall-off-the-bone pork baby back ribs done on the
            grill.</p>
        <p>This recipe assumes the use of a charcoal grill (like a Weber kettle
            grill) but can be adapted to work on a gas grill just as well.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 racks of pork baby back ribs</li>
            <li>Yellow Mustard (used as binder)</li>
            <li>Your favorite rub</li>
            <li>Melted Butter</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>Apple Juice</li>
            <li>Your favorite sauce or a sauce to pair with the rub</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat ribs dry.</li>
            <li>Remove silver skin from back of ribs.</li>
            <li>Rub ribs with Yellow Mustard on top and bottom.</li>
            <li>Generously sprinkle both sides of the ribs with your favorite
                rub. <strong>DO NOT RUB IT IN</strong>. It will adhere to the
                yellow mustard and stick to the ribs.</li>
            <li>Let ribs rest on a baking sheet in the fridge for at least 4
                hours,preferably overnight. If you are short on time, you can
                let the ribs rest on the counter at room temperature for an
                hour.</li>
            <li>Prepare grill.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put charcoal in charcoal chimney and light
                        charcoal.</li>
                    <li>Once charcoal is lit, pour it out of the chimney and
                        push one half to one side and the other half to the
                        other side, leaving a hole in the middle.</li>
                    <li>Put a foil drip pan in the space between the coals.</li>
                    <li>Fill drip pan with water.</li>
                    <li>Put lid on grill and adjust vents so the dome
                        temperature is between 250&deg;F and 300&deg;F.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, add wood chunks to charcoal for smoky
                        flavor.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Once grill is up to temp, put ribs meat side up in the center
                of the grill over the drip pan.</li>
            <li>Close lid and grill until meat pulls back from ends of ribs,
                about 2 hours, adding charcoal as needed.</li>
            <li>Put each rack of ribs on a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Brush Melted Butter onto meat side of ribs.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle meat side of ribs with brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Wrap ribs in aluminum foil, leaving one end open.</li>
            <li>Pour 4-8 oz of Apple Juice in each foil packet.</li>
            <li>Seal foil packets.</li>
            <li>Return foil packets to grill, meat side down.</li>
            <li>Grill until ribs reach 200&deg;F-210&deg;F.</li>
            <li>If adding sauce, unwrap ribs meat side up, apply sauce, and
                grill for another 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove ribs from grill and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut ribs into 1-3 rib sections. Plate and serve.</li>
        </ol>
