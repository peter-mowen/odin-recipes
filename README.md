# Basic Recipe Website

This is my implementation of the
[Recipes Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
from The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. This
project will be revisited in the future to style it with CSS.
