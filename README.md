# Basic Recipe Website

This is my implementation of the
[Recipes Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
from The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. The
purpose of this iteration was just to practice basic HTML. While it is not much
to look at now, this project will be revisited in the future to style it with
CSS.
